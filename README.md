# remindme

A react-native reminder app that uses typescript, redux-toolkit, async-storage and react-native-push-notification.

This app focuses on taking notes of what the user wants to be reminded of and also alerting the user when it is time according to the time they set to be reminded.

These reminders can be one-time, hourly, daily or weekly. The user can also either pin, mark as done or delete the alarm(which also stops the upcoming notification).
